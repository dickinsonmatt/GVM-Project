# GVM-Project
Data and code for STA 419 Project on the GV Magazine

The following is the abstract from the concluding report on this analysis. 

This report employs a survey to gauge readers' experiences with and attitudes toward both the print issues and the website articles of Grand Valley Magazine (GVM). The primary objectives are to identify areas for improvement for GVM, produce data relevant to the magazineâ€™s return on investment (ROI), and offer readers the option to continue receiving print issues as GVM shifts to primarily website articles. This report analyzes survey responses (n = 1000) gathered from the GVM email list in Fall Semester 2023 utilizing a fifteen-question survey, with a focus on the two demographic variables: age group, and the respondents' relation to Grand Valley State University (GVSU). The survey responses are visualized in R and faceted by demographic variables, particularly age for each question. A Chi-squared test of independence is used to determine if age is significantly related with answers to each survey question. A comparative chi-squared analysis with a similar survey conducted in 2021 is also undertaken to evaluate changes from 2021 to 2023.
